# homininPaleoTS
A small collection of general and wrapper functions that support the article Evolutionary drivers of encephalization and facial reduction in the genus Homo

The functions inside this folder will be called by the Quarto document shared with the paper that replicates the analyses and results reported in the article and supplementary information.
For any questions, reach out to me via mhubbe@utk.edu
